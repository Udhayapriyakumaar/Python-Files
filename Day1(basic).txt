1.Printing

print("Day 1 - Python Print Function")
print("The function is declared like this:")
print("print('what to print')")

Printing the multiple sentence by single code.

\n indicates the next sentence should be in the next line

example
print("Hello\nHello\nHello")
An:
Hello
Hello
Hello

we can CONCATENATE the strings.

print("Hello"+"Udhaya")
Ans:
HelloUdhaya

here there is no space between the hello and udhaya
There are 3 ways to give space they are,

1. add space after Hello string
example:
print("Hello "+"Udhaya")

2. add space before Udhaya string starts
example:
print("Hello"+" Udhaya")

3. add space in between the strings
example:
print("Hello"+" "+"Udhaya")


these 3 ways gives the answer as 

Hello Udhaya

Errors:

space - indentation error
missing " -Syntax error

code challenge-debugging the error

print("Day 1 - String Manipulation")
print('String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign.')
print('e.g. print("Hello " + "world")')
print("New lines can be created with a backslash and n.")

Ans:
Day 1 - String Manipulation
String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign.
e.g. print("Hello " + "world")
New lines can be created with a backslash and n.

INPUT Function

code execution does not end it wait until for the user input

example1:
input("What is your name?")

ans:
What is your name?Udhaya

example2:
print("Hello "+input("What is your name?"))

ans:
What is your name?Udhaya
Hello Udhaya

# is used for single line comment
""" comment """  for multiline comment

INTERACTIVE CODING EXERCISE

Write a program that prints the number of characters in a user's name. You might need to Google for a function that calculates the length of a string.

print(len(input("What is your name?")))

ans:
What is your name?Udhaya
6

PYTHON VARIABLES

variables are reference to the future view
Phone book in mobile
example : james=123456678
the particular number associated with the name james

example1:
name=input("What is your name?")
print(name)

ans:
What is your name?Udhaya
Udhaya

example2:
name="Jack"
print(name)
name="Udhaya"
print(name)

ans:
Jack
Udhaya

example3:
name=input("What is your name?")
length=len(name)
print(length)

ans:

What is your name?Udhaya
6


INTERACTIVE CODING

Write a program that switches the values stored in the variables a and b

CODE:

a=input("a: ")
b=input("b: ")
print("a: "+b)
print("b: "+a)

Ans:
a: 3
b: 5
a: 5
b: 3

VARIABLE NAMING

We cannot have space in variable
instead we can have _

example

user_name

We cannot start with number for variable

12can = give syntax error

declaring the variable and print, while printing if we written a wrong variable name then it is gives
 Name Error
